Summary: simple script to follow another accounts scrobbles (ie for office use)

After quite a long time, I finally decided to put some hardware I had lying around to use (a Trim-Slice) as a low-power MPD device. So now there's an office music player. And I've set it up to scrobble to an office account.

But what about my own? Paul Lamere had apparently written a solution for that and he wrote an article about it: http://musicmachinery.com/2010/06/11/metoo-a-scrobbler-for-the-room/ but never published the code. Boo-urns!

So, here's my version.  It has some sharp edges, but it does the trick.

Features:
* Mac OS X specific idle time support; since I'm running this on a desktop workstation instead of my laptop
* All settings stored in a handy dandy JSON file
* Supports Now Playing as well as recent tracks

Install:
* Requires python27 (json, subprocess.check_output) and pylast
* Copy settings.example to settings
* Requires an API Key, see http://www.last.fm/api/account
* Put in your crontab
